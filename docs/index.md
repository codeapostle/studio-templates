# The Health Care System.
**HCS** is just an abbreviation of **_HEALTH CARE SYSTEM_** an idea fundamental to optimise health care by building the core realiable infrastructures for rapid growth of the ecosystem.

The fundamental objectives of HCS are as follows in order of priorties:
* Provide a consistent, accurate representation of medical histories.
* Enable fast collaborative healthcare and decentralization of health resources for depth and coverage.
* Provide a unified interface between digital healthcare infrasturues with private (i.e HMOs)  and goverment parastals (NIMC).

**HCS** is meant to connect everything from roadside chemist, labouratory, individual clinics, private & public health institutions. An exclusive goal to make non EHR based healthcare also extinct within the space of seven or six years.

## Why HCS?
The simple truth is `FORESIGHT`. Post COVID-19, there as been a high increase of health care companies and startups working on various problems, which means the eco-system is unapologetically growing at an alarming rate. The biggest problem a new ecosystem can invest in is an `Infrastructural Debt`, avoiding such debt is just preferable for everyone, because this allows an accelerated ecosystem, where people are not building and fighting infrastructural debt. `Infrastructural Debt` is when the required structures and processes to drive an accelerated growth is missing or inadequate, trying to speed on a bad or untarred road is an example, sooner or later, you will either need a mechanic or a doctor.
It's also incredibly difficult to be racing (in a car) and building (the road) at the same time, nearly imposible due to strain of resource.

The other part of the truth is that a `Segregated Data Silo's` irrefocablely is going to do alot of harm than good. The problem of normalization of data entries is going to arise because each individual systems are going to store differently, and the objective is provide actionable data for creating a preventive society compared to the current corrective state of healthcare. Apart from digital solutions, registering a new hospital, pharamacy legally, realtime concurrent state of an healthcare facility can't be done today,leading to quacks, untrained going unnoticed. A segregated solution will lead to seperation of collaborative evidences leading to quacks and fraudsters in the system.

## How HCS works?.
HCS provides a `global card number` for every registered member on it's platform attributed to the user or patient across the network.
### Case A: Implicit Aggregation and Collection.
Mr A visits a private hopsital with EMR X, from the consultation, he was asked to go and do ABC Test and was given a shortcode A-B-C, he goes out of the hospital to a medical labouratory using software or EMR Y, the lab scientist takes the code and see the recommended test and sumbits the result to EMR Y containing the shortcode or Mr A phone number, HCS sends the result to EMR X, immediately. Mr A goes back to the hospital and prescribed drugs BCD, EMR X intergration with HCS will provide access to the database of pharamcies that the prescription can be discharged or purchased. Mr A goes to pharamacy Z, he purchases the prescription any submission with the HCS shortcode or phone number will link back to the consultant EMR X about the discharged. Assuming Mr A, fees is been covered by an HMO, an implicit and explict alert is sent to HMO's and any coverage is disbursed to the hospital with EMR X, Labouratory with EMR Y and Pharmacist with EMR Z simulatenously.
### Case B: Collaborative Health Care & Decentralization of Resources.
Assuming Mr A from above is recieving a simulatenous contractiory care or has an allergy, HCS can send an alert to EMR X, simply notifying that a contractiory care or allergic substansce is been given to Mr A. This saves Mr A and the consultant from unneccessary troubles.  
Assuming Mr A is having a complication, 
knowlegde to manage situations will become common, offloading tertiary health services.
### Case C: Infrastrutural Update.
EMR company A can create a new institutuion on its platform, co-ordinating KYC and verification of required documents and accept registration fees for it's clients. The client details are added to all National Health Institution Registery and Parastals. The client, staffs are also added to the various registeries if they pass personnel verification requirements for various health professions.
